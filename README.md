# Event Logger

Event Logger is a lightweight, non-blocking logging utility designed for Node.js applications. It allows you to log events asynchronously via a worker-based architecture, ensuring the main thread remains unaffected.

## Features

- **Non-blocking logging**: Uses worker threads under the hood.
- **Customizable**: Accepts user-defined event attributes.
- **Environment-aware**: Logs events with environment context (production, staging, development).
- **Scalable**: Handles high-frequency logging efficiently.
- **TypeScript ready**: Fully typed for a better developer experience.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install log-viewer-sdk-node
```
